# How to Begin Technical Writing - TIL (Today I Learned) format

As a form of communication, technical writing attempts to make the ideas in a technical field (like programming or software development) as clear and concise as possible, especially when communicating with other experts and people outside that field.

The audience and purpose determine the format of technical writing. Technical articles are typically written in several forms.

* A step-by-step tutorial: "How to Set Up an OpenStack Environment."
* An overview of the architecture: "Full Guide to Cloud Computing Architecture."
* An in-depth examination of a technical concept: "What is Machine Learning?"
* A comprehensive resource round-up: "The Best Resources for Learning AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science from the Ground Up."


**TIL (Today I Learned)** is a great format to get started when overwhelmed by where to start. This format of writing helps in sharing and documenting the things learned on a daily basis. If you learn something that is small, simply write down the problem you have resolved and the solution you have identified and publish.


 The general format of **TIL** is as follows:
1.  Introduction: Two or three phrases that describe the problem.
2.  Body: A couple of phrases about the solution and how you came.
3.  Final solution: Share tiny snippets of code here, which are easy to copy and paste.
4.  Conclusion: One or two phrases to reclaim the problem and solution by linking to social media handle or shouting at the end of your newsletter.

 TIL format has numerous benefits. At the outset, it is essential to keep a record of the issues encountered with possible solutions on a daily basis. Other people also benefit from it. This format helps to collect seemingly small things that have a significant impact. The solution to a problem is forgotten over time, so it's essential to document these issues as they occur.

 It offers you a hard-to-change article that you can return to and insert at a later date. You may discover that people will keep on asking you to explain things. The article can be re-written, and the next time you remember it, you can make an update.

 In the end, technical writing, editing, and publishing become better skills. Focus on getting the content out there, even if the article's length may be an issue.
